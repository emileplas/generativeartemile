        <p>Brasília is the federal capital of Brazil. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital.</p>
        <p>What makes Brasilia so different, is that Brasília was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The city consists of different blocks, each with their own functions. Brasilia is characterised by wide streets, with lots of greenery, and the (artificial) lake that surrounds the city.</p>
        <p>In the city of Brasilia, all kinds of art with tiles by the hand of Athos Bulcão are found. The objective of the current project is to create a similar work of tile art, albeit this time with code written in javascript using p5js.</p>
        <p>The difference with the permanent tile structures of Athos Bulcão, is that nowhere in the code is it predetermined which tiles will be situated where. This ensures that the computer randomly determines which structures are located where on the tile wall. So every time the page is refreshed, the tile artwork will be different.</p>
        <p>This project is dedicated to my wife, Raquel, for her endless support of my projects. It is an ode to her hometown and her roots. Without her, these codes would never have been written.</p>
